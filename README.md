**Purpose:**

*   To provide a demo of minimal setup example of a PHP application.
*   To show how to connect PHP to a Microsoft SQL Server database.
*   To serve as a starting point for building more complex web applications using this stack.

**Getting Started:**

1.  Ensure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed.
2.  Navigate to the project root directory in your terminal.
3.  Run `docker compose up --build` to build the images and start the containers (PHP web server and SQL Server).
4.  The PHP application should be accessible at `http://localhost:8080`.
5.  The SQL Server database will be running and accessible from the PHP container.

**Project Structure:**

*   `src/`: Contains the PHP source files (`index.php`, `about.php`).
*   `mssql/`: Contains Dockerfile and scripts for setting up the SQL Server database (`Dockerfile`, `configure-db.sh`, `entrypoint.sh`, `setup.sql`).
*   `php/`: Contains the Dockerfile for the PHP web server.
*   `compose.yaml`: Defines the services (PHP and SQL Server) and their configuration using Docker Compose.
*   `default.conf`: Nginx configuration file for the PHP service.
*   `.idx/dev.nix`: Development environment configuration (for specific IDE setups).
*   `.vscode/`: VS Code configuration files.
*   `CREDITS.md`: Project credits.

**Customization:**

*   Modify the PHP files in `src/` to change the application logic.
*   Update the `mssql/setup.sql` file to modify the database schema or seed data.
*   Adjust `compose.yaml` to change service configurations, ports, etc.
*   Customize `.idx/dev.nix` for your development environment setup (if using Nix).
